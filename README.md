# java-binomial-expansion
Java challenge from sololearn.com

The program computes and prints the expansion of the binomial (X+Y)^N. 
Here X and Y are variables of the binomial and N is the power of the binomial
and you have to receive N from the user. 

Example: For given N=2, the output must be X^2+2XY+Y^2 
(here "^" is short for "to the power of").
